         <h2>Historical Golden Throne</h2>
         <p>According to tradition, the throne belonged to the Pandavas of Mahabharata fame and was in Hastinapura. Kampilaraya
        brought this throne from Hastinapura to Penugonda, now in Andhra Pradesh, where it was kept underground. In 1336 AD,
        Vidyaranya, the royal preceptor of the Vijayanagar kings, showed the spot where it was buried to Harihara I, one of the
        founders of the Vijayanagar empire, who retrieved the throne. The throne was then used by the Vijayanagar kings at
        Anegondi for more than a century and a half. During the early part of the 17th century the Governor of Vijayanagar
        rulers at Srirangapatna obtained the throne. In 1609, the governor Srirangaraya gave the throne to Raja Wodeyar. In
        1610, Raja Wodeyar ascended the throne. Inaugurated the Dasara festivities. Epigraphical evidence shows that this royal
        throne was in the possession of Chikkadevaraya Wodeyar in 1699.</p>

        <h2>Historical information about "King mukut"</h2>
        <p>The origins of the Nagvanshis are shrouded in mystery.[5] Nagvanshi claim descent from Nagas.[6][7] According to
        Nagvanshavali (genealogy of Nagvanshi), Nagvanshi dynasty originated with Pundarika Naga the son of Takshaka. The son of
        Pundarika Naga, Phani Mukut Rai was founder of Nagvanshi dynasty.[8] Phani Mukut Rai was born on return journey from
        Puri to Varanasi. The Pundarika Naga turned Cobra after revealing his identity and his wife Parvati commited Sati. Later
        the Sakaldwipiya Brahmin found the child and took the child to Madura Munda, the chief of Sutiambe village. Madura Munda
        and other Raja such as King of Surguja and Aditya king of Patkum elected Phani Mukut Rai as King due to his
        qualities.[9] His empire was named ‘Nagpur’. However, the story of Phani Mukut Rai is mostly considered to be a myth and
        an invented story of Brahminacal origin of the dynasty.[10][11][12][8] According to Herbert Hope Risley, the family had
        been hinduised by the 17th century by producing family miracles linking the dynasty to Pundarika Naga, a mythical Naga
        and constructing temples. After witnessing the court of Mughals and acquaintance with Hindu kings of North India, the
        kings of Chotanagpur gathered the Brahmin priests, Rajput and pseudo-Rajput courtiers.[13]</p>

        <h2>King George VI Falls</h2>
        <p>King George VI Falls, also known as Salto Oshi or Oshi Falls, is located on the Oshi River in the Cuyuni-Mazaruni region
        of Guyana.</p>
        <p>This waterfall is rarely visited.[2] The exact height waterfall used to be unknown, but was measured in 2014 at 214
        metres (702 ft)[1] Though it is not as tall as it has long been thought to be, it is notable for its combination of
        height and great volume of water, along with its being a sheer plunge. The overhanging cliff gives a visual illusion of
        a much bigger fall.[1]</p>
        <details>
        <p>The first westerner to see the falls was reportedly American entomologist and physician Paul A. Zahl in 1938.[2] Height
        of this waterfall has often been reported to be 1,600 feet, and that figure has been published many times over several
        decades, but it is greatly exaggerated.[2] The error originated from imprecise measurements of Paul A. Zahl who
        estimated the height of falls by throwing large rocks and counting seconds until the stones fell down.</p>

           <h2>kingdom</h2>
           <p>A kingdom is a piece of land that is ruled by a king or a queen. A kingdom is often called a monarchy, which means that
          one person, usually inheriting their position by birth or marriage, is the leader, or head of state.</p>
          <p>Kingdoms are one of the earliest types of societies on Earth, dating back thousands of years. There have been hundreds,
          if not thousands, of different kingdoms throughout history. Kingdoms can be huge, such as the United Kingdom. During the
          nineteenth century, the United Kingdom, ruled from London, England, stretched over five continents. Kingdoms can also be
          small, such as the kingdom of Brunei, which is smaller than the U.S. state of Delaware.</p>
          <p>Kingdoms are rarely ruled by an absolute monarch, a single king or queen who makes all decisions for the entire state.
          Kingdoms are usually broken into smaller territories, such as city-states or provinces, that are governed by officials
          who report to the monarch. Most modern kings and queens do not control the government. Elected leaders and constitutions
          establish laws for most kingdoms today.</p>
